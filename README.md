Scope fix has been implemented into actual mw base! I will not remove the addon for those who use outdated compressed packs or other circumstances

Due to some issues with the latest update sniper scopes being blurry I decided to make this for my server and I am sharing this with the gmod community

All it does is auto disable blur fx which are causing the problem

Good for server owners or people who want to keep it disabled because it reenabled itself multiple times today... or people who play a crap ton of multiplayer

Only took me 5 minutes to make

Q: Why is it so small

A: its a single lua file with a single line idk what else im supposed to say

Q: What does it do

A: It disables a problematic setting (Aka blur) but A U T O M A T I C A L L Y
